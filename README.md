- This is the first website I've built that actually has potential practical purpose and functionality.
- Basic HTML and CSS is good enough for now
* Needs links to social media in footer
* Needs a page for each photograhy package type (protrait, wedding, newborn)
* Needs a dropdown with links to package type pages, inline with the bio/contact links in nav bar
* Needs some kind of embedded Paypal / Venmo payment method
* Needs webform for new clients
